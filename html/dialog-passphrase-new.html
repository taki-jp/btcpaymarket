   Your twelve-word wallet passphrase is shown in the black box above.  Write it down and keep it safe.  If you lose this passphrase, you will lose access to your wallet forever.  If someone gets your passphrase, they gain access to your wallet.  We do not store your passphrase and cannot recover it if lost.

<div class="row" style="padding: 5px 20px 15px 20px;" align="left">
   You can encrypt your passphrase in browser storage by selecting the Encrypt button.  This will prevent access to your wallet after you close the browser window should someone gain physical access to your device.  You can also choose Manual if you already have a passphrase (you will have the option to encrypt a passphrase entered manually).
